### Neon Mondrian:



### Sound Visualization:

I chose the song "Catch It" from a database of free songs online. It's upbeat, medium paced and matched the feeling I wanted to invoke with my visualization.

Inspired by the grooves on old records, I wanted to use polar coordinates to create a drawing that spiraled out from the center of the canvas, but also looked like a random walk through the canvas.

I split the array returned by ```getPeaks()``` into 2, so different parts of the song contributed to the *radius* and *angle* coordinates of the drawing.

In the end I added some sliders to control some scaling factors that could be used to adjust the drawing and how much space it takes on the screen.
